# BUILD-23 — Migration gate: a promotion to any environment must not
# proceed unless its database is successfully migrated first. Reuses
# BUILD-22's advisory-locked runMigrations() directly (not a
# reimplementation) — a concurrent deploy racing against this same gate
# is exactly the scenario that lock protects against.
#
# Exit code: 0 if migrations applied (or were already up to date),
# non-zero on any migration failure — a CI/deploy pipeline should treat
# non-zero here as a hard stop, never proceeding to promote traffic to
# the new version.
#
# Usage:
#   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://<admin-role>:<pw>@<host>:5432/<db>" \
#     ./migration-gate.sh
