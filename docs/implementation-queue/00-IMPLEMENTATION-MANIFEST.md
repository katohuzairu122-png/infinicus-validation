## Superseded Builds

| ID | Layer | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| BUILD-11 | PLATFORM/FUNCTIONAL_PIPELINE | Governed MVP Decision Pipeline | superseded — never executed |

BUILD-11's specification (`BUILD-11-GOVERNED-DECISION-PIPELINE-SPECIFICATION.md`)
is kept for history only. `CLAUDE-MASTER-EXECUTION-INSTRUCTIONS.md` (repo root)
explicitly supersedes it: *"BUILD-11 is superseded. Keep its history, but
never execute it."* The required build route is
`BUILD-10 → BUILD-12 → BUILD-13 → … → BUILD-30`. Confirmed by user decision
2026-07-22.

## Current Ready Build

None. Per `BUILD-19-ONBOARDING-SPECIFICATION.md` §8/§10 ("Do not
automatically start the next build"), BUILD-20 is not marked ready by
this build's completion. A future session must explicitly re-verify
BUILD-20's preconditions before readying it. BUILD-19 delivered a
resumable tenant onboarding wizard on top of the pre-existing
tenancy/platform/identity schema and BUILD-18's authorization machinery
(one new schema, one new table, migrations 0138-0141).

## Pending Builds

| ID | Layer | Description | Depends on |
|---|---|---|---|
| BUILD-20 | WORKFLOW | Workflow engine | BUILD-19 (completed) |
| BUILD-21 | API | API layer | BUILD-20 |
| BUILD-22 | PROD-DB | Production database readiness | BUILD-21 |
| BUILD-23 | DEPLOY | Deployment | BUILD-22 |
| BUILD-24 | SECRETS | Secrets management | BUILD-23 |
| BUILD-25 | OBS | Observability | BUILD-24 |
| BUILD-26 | SEC-PRIV | Security and privacy | BUILD-25 |
| BUILD-27 | PERF | Performance | BUILD-26 |
| BUILD-28 | BILLING | Billing | BUILD-27 |
| BUILD-29 | INCIDENT | Incident response | BUILD-28 |
| BUILD-30 | LAUNCH | Launch readiness | BUILD-29 |

All specifications for BUILD-13 through BUILD-30 are staged in this
directory (frozen, checksum-verified against their source packages) but
remain `pending` until their dependency completes — only one build is
`ready` at a time per `CLAUDE-QUEUE-INSTRUCTIONS.md`. See
`docs/architecture/PERSISTENCE-STAGE-MAP.md`,
`docs/implementation-queue/MASTER-PRODUCTION-ROUTE.md`, and
`CLAUDE-MASTER-EXECUTION-INSTRUCTIONS.md` (repo root) for the full route,
and `docs/architecture/DECISION-LEDGER.md` for frozen architectural
decisions (AD-001 through AD-027) governing all remaining builds.

Also unresolved from BUILD-10 (candidate future work, no specification
authored yet): fixing the `digital-twin/dt-bundle.js` header-comment syntax
defect (`.claude/state/reports/BUILD-10-PLATFORM-completion.md`); adding
`vitest` to (or removing the unusable `test` script from) the 18 placeholder
monorepo packages; wiring `DT-24`→Simulation and `ADI-24`→ABA; completing
the six placeholder handoff-contract files.

## BUILD-06 Specification: ADI Layer

### Objective

Create the root-level `ai-decision-intelligence/` directory with 25 blocks
in browser-global IIFE format, produce `adi-bundle.js`, and wire it into `index.html`.

### Source Material

ES module implementations exist in:
`infinicus-platform/layers/ai-decision-intelligence/blocks/INFINICUS-ADI-{NN}-*/`

All 25 blocks are implemented and all 106 tests pass in Node.js.

### Output Structure

```
ai-decision-intelligence/
  INFINICUS-ADI-01-AI-Decision-Intelligence-Core-Runtime-Registry/
  INFINICUS-ADI-02-Decision-Request-Intake-Validation-Engine/
  ... (ADI-03 through ADI-24)
  INFINICUS-ADI-25-AI-Decision-Intelligence-Master-Integration-Deployment-Engine/
  adi-bundle.js
```

### Bundle Global Namespace

```js
global.INFINICUS.ADI = {
  runtime,       // ADI-01 runtime instance
  // ADI-02 through ADI-24 services attached to runtime
  // ADI-25 master integration attached last
}
```

### index.html Integration

Add before the closing `</body>` tag, in dependency order after dt-bundle.js:

```html
<script src="/ai-decision-intelligence/adi-bundle.js"></script>
```

### Validation Commands

```bash
node --check ai-decision-intelligence/adi-bundle.js
for dir in ai-decision-intelligence/INFINICUS-ADI-*/; do
  for test in "$dir/tests/"*.mjs; do
    node "$test"
  done
done
```

### Required Completion Report

`.claude/state/reports/BUILD-06-ADI-completion.md`

### Success Criteria

- 25 root-level block directories exist
- `adi-bundle.js` syntax-checks clean
- All block tests pass
- `index.html` loads adi-bundle.js
- All existing layer tests still pass (regression)

## BUILD-07 Specification: SIM Layer Integration Cleanup

**Authoritative specification:** [BUILD-07-SIM-SPECIFICATION.md](./BUILD-07-SIM-SPECIFICATION.md)
(frozen 2026-07-21; implemented and completed 2026-07-21 — see
`.claude/state/reports/BUILD-07-SIM-completion.md`).

### Objective (summary)

Integrate the existing INFINICUS Engine v3 Simulation capability
(`window.INFINICUS.SIMULATION.*` in root `index.html`) with the modular
architecture and the completed ADI layer through typed ports, a narrow
browser adapter, and a complete SIM-to-ADI handoff contract — replacing the
"not connected" ADI-06/ADI-16 stub adapters. BUILD-07 must not create or
rewrite the Simulation engine; established Monte Carlo behaviour (500 runs,
90-day horizon) is preserved. Simulation produces evidence; ADI evaluates it.
No recommendation or approval authority moves into SIM. No database schema or
migrations.

See the dedicated specification for the full scope, architecture boundary,
port and contract requirements, characterization/parity requirements,
validation gates, and success criteria.

## BUILD-08 Specification: DAL Root Blocks

**Authoritative specification:** [BUILD-08-DAL-SPECIFICATION.md](./BUILD-08-DAL-SPECIFICATION.md)
(frozen 2026-07-21; implemented and completed 2026-07-21 — see
`.claude/state/reports/BUILD-08-DAL-completion.md`).

### Objective (summary)

Assemble the 25 completed Data Acquisition browser-runtime blocks
(`infinicus-platform/layers/data-acquisition/blocks/INFINICUS-DA-01…25`,
already browser-global IIFEs, all source tests passing) into a root-level
`data-acquisition/` layer with `da-bundle.js` exposing `window.INFINICUS.DA`,
wired into `index.html` before `dt-bundle.js`, and complete the strict
versioned DAL-to-BO handoff contract (`dal-to-bo.ts`), aligned with
`da.data.published` and Stage 2B `publication_packages`. DAL means
Data Acquisition Layer (settled by the 2026-07-21 audit). No DA algorithm
changes, no database changes, no Stage 2B duplication, no CL-to-DAL
feedback, no BUILD-09.

---

## BUILD-09 Specification: DB-BI Database Stage 2D

**Authoritative specification:** [BUILD-09-DB-BI-SPECIFICATION.md](./BUILD-09-DB-BI-SPECIFICATION.md)
(frozen 2026-07-21; implemented and completed 2026-07-21 — see
`.claude/state/reports/BUILD-09-DB-BI-completion.md`).

### Objective (summary)

Implement Database Stage 2D — Business Intelligence persistence only: a new
`business_intelligence` PostgreSQL schema (migrations starting at `0037`,
frozen 0001–0036 untouched), tenant-isolated RLS-enabled-and-forced tables
for intake/lineage, analytical datasets, metrics/KPIs, analysis lifecycle,
findings, trends, forecasts, anomalies, benchmarks, risk intelligence, and
publication/registry — plus strict TypeScript repository adapters and BI
outbox events. Consumes validated `business_operations.bo_publication_packages`
via a completed `bo-to-bi.ts` handoff contract; publishes onward declarations
only to Digital Twin, Simulation, and ADI (no downstream implementation).
Requires ≥100 meaningful live PostgreSQL 16 integration tests. This is
database/repository work only — it does not touch the completed browser BI
root blocks (BUILD-02) and does not implement analytical algorithms.

---

## BUILD-10 Specification: PLATFORM Assembly

**Authoritative specification:** [BUILD-10-PLATFORM-SPECIFICATION.md](./BUILD-10-PLATFORM-SPECIFICATION.md)
(frozen 2026-07-21; SHA-256 `878ff02a4f3865fb2a06ffc33b71d7c614ec65e810f92926a0cd27f0abc081c7`;
implemented and completed 2026-07-22 — see
`.claude/state/reports/BUILD-10-PLATFORM-completion.md`).

### Objective (summary)

Full browser platform assembly, orchestration, wiring, and end-to-end
validation of all completed INFINICUS Engine v3 layers. Adds one new file,
`platform/platform-bootstrap.js` (loaded via one new deferred `<script>` tag
inserted after the ADI bundle in `index.html`), establishing a
`window.INFINICUS.PLATFORM` namespace that reports readiness of the 8
browser-applicable layers (DA, BI, DT, SIM, ADI, ABA, OM, CL) using each
layer's own existing diagnostic surface, plus a static, verified record of
the 9 cross-layer handoff boundaries (3 persistence-backed/complete, 1
functional browser adapter, 3 browser-wired-but-not-contract-validated, 2
confirmed not wired). Business Operations has no browser layer and is
explicitly out of the namespace contract. BUILD-10 does not modify any
completed layer, any existing bundle, any of the 6 placeholder handoff-
contract files, or any migration (0001–0049 remain frozen). No Stage 2E or
later persistence, no new event backbone, no external broker, no UI
redesign, no production deployment. See the dedicated specification for the
full namespace contract, state machine, handoff map, capability registry,
test plan, and validation commands.

## BUILD-11 (superseded, never executed): Governed MVP Decision Pipeline

**Specification (history only):** [BUILD-11-GOVERNED-DECISION-PIPELINE-SPECIFICATION.md](./BUILD-11-GOVERNED-DECISION-PIPELINE-SPECIFICATION.md)
(SHA-256 `142d260faeeef43582a5645e1bdcbbce84732691d7be4304839eb38c7c61e2c7`;
superseded 2026-07-22 — see `CLAUDE-MASTER-EXECUTION-INSTRUCTIONS.md`).

Would have completed the `BI→DT`, `DT→SIM`, and `ADI→ABA` placeholder
handoff contracts and wired a browser vertical slice
`BI→DT→SIM→ADI→ABA`. Explicitly excluded from the required build route by
`CLAUDE-MASTER-EXECUTION-INSTRUCTIONS.md`, which routes directly from
BUILD-10 to BUILD-12 (database persistence). Do not mark ready. Do not
implement.

---

## BUILD-12 Specification: DB-DT Database Stage 2E

**Authoritative specification:** [BUILD-12-DB-DT-SPECIFICATION.md](./BUILD-12-DB-DT-SPECIFICATION.md)
(frozen; SHA-256 `571b2aae5bdc68ba8755d8e88b4197a986e519f8cb86ae40a3983c17fe504420`;
status: completed — see `.claude/state/reports/BUILD-12-DB-DT-completion.md`).

### Objective (summary)

Implement Database Stage 2E — Business Digital Twin persistence: a new
`business_digital_twin` PostgreSQL schema (migration numbers to be
determined by directory inspection at implementation time, not guessed;
frozen `0001`–`0049` untouched) persisting twin definitions/versions,
state snapshots, state variables, entities/relationships, assumptions and
constraints, calibration/validation, uncertainty/confidence, scenario
baselines, evidence/lineage, publication, and registry/deployment. Depends
only on BUILD-09 (Stage 2D, completed) — explicitly independent of the
BUILD-10/BUILD-11 browser track. Completes the `bi-to-dt.ts` handoff
contract (currently a placeholder) and publishes onward via a `dt-to-sim.ts`
completion for Simulation to consume in a later build. 12 named
repositories required. Does not implement Simulation persistence (BUILD-13)
or any browser wiring.
